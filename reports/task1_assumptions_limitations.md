# Task 1 – Assumptions and Limitations

## Assumptions

- Brent oil prices reflect global supply and demand conditions
- Major geopolitical and economic events influence price behavior
- Structural changes in prices can be detected statistically

## Limitations

- Change point detection identifies temporal correlation, not causation
- Multiple events may occur close together in time
- Market reactions may be delayed or anticipatory
- Oil prices are influenced by unobserved factors such as speculation,
  technological change, and local disruptions

## Interpretation Note

Results from change point analysis should be interpreted as probabilistic
evidence rather than definitive causal proof.
