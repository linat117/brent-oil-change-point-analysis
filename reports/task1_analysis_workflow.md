# Task 1 – Analysis Workflow

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to understand how major geopolitical,
economic, and policy-related events influence Brent oil prices by identifying
structural changes in the price time series.

## Analysis Steps

1. Load and clean Brent oil price data
2. Parse and standardize date formats
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
   - Visualize long-term trends
   - Examine volatility patterns
4. Test time series properties
   - Stationarity testing
   - Return and volatility analysis
5. Apply Bayesian change point detection (Task 2)
6. Associate detected change points with real-world events
7. Communicate insights through reports and dashboards

## Expected Outcome

The analysis is expected to identify periods where oil price behavior
changes significantly and provide quantitative insight into the impact
of major global events on price dynamics.
